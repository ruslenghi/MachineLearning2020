# MachineLearning2020
My academic projects in Machine learning. I worked on them in a group of two people, "Graphkrone" with @marcello-negri, between March 2020 and June 2020 at ETH Zurich for the course Introduction to Machine Learning.

These projects allowed me to get practical experience on the topics of: Linear-Regression, Regularizers, Cross-Validation, Neural-Networks, Convolutional-Neural-Networks, PCA, K-means, feature engineering, data preprocessing, data visualization, data imbalance and with the libraries Sklearn, Tensorflow.
