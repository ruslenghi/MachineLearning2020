## Prediction of illness for hospitalized people (Final grade: 6/6)

In this task, relevant quantities (represented by both real numbers and booleans) such as: body temperature(real), insuline levels(real), sepsis(boolean) etc. are given for a wide set of patients (17000). This values are recorded for 12h + 12h (one day in total). We trained ElasticNet and MLPRegressor to forcast the vital parameters of people in the second 12h given the values of the same vital parameters in the first 12h. Also, some further difficulties of this task were represented by **missing data** (patients' vital values are not sampled every 60 minutes in the real world, and in this problem as well), **importance sampling** (some patients are outliers, for example they might have a sepsis, an infection that might lead to death), **feature engineering** (some very relevant quantities are missing in the dataset, for examlpe the temperature is given, but the change of it along the 12h is not, however it is clearly relevant to the evolution of the patient's conditions in the next 12h).

Regardless of the grade obtained this task taught me and my group a lot, as we had to **visualize data** , **test different models** such as linear regression and neural nets, make extensive use of **cross-validation**, perform **feature engineering** and **data-preprocessing** to solve it. We also attacked this task with many techniques, **PCA**, **up-sampling**, **down-samlping**, that turned out to be unsuitable for the solution, but trying them out has been useful nonetheless.
